Whenever I use a new product, I love to take a close look at its UI/UX. I like to think about why the Product Manager or Designer chose certain elements and imagine what I might have done differently if I were in their shoes.

Here, I've gathered a collection of some standout (and a few not so great) UI/UX designs I've encountered. This is a living list, so I'll be updating it from time to time.
