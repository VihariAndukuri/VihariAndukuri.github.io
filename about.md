# **Hi, I'm Vihari.**

<br>

Iâ€™m a Product Manager from Bangalore. I am passionate about building products, both Physical and Digital.

Currently, I am part of the Product team at Tekion; working on a revolutionary, new-age E-Commerce platform for Automotive Retail.

Before this, I worked as a Hardware Electronics Engineer at Johnson Controls. Here, I had worked on the design of Smart Thermostats and IOT sensors that are currently being used in a number of Smart Buildings all over the world. 

I also have 2 Patents from USPTO for some of the work I had done at Johnson Controls

###### ***Jul 2017 - May 2021***

<br>

At Johnson Controls, I worked on End to End Product Design (Development through Production) of IOT sensors and Smart Thermostats.

While my primary responsibility was hardware circuit design, I got the opportunity to work on the entire Product Life Cycle.

I worked on

- Product ideation (Market research, competitor teardown, customer interview, brainstorming)
- Market sizing and revenue projection
- Validating MVP with pilot customers
- Testing & Debugging 
- Design for mass manufacture
- Field validation.

 This helped me discover my love for building products and steered me towards a career in Product Management. 

Here are some of cool products I had worked on at Johnson Controls.
