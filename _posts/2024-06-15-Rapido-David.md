title: Rapido's David vs Goliaths
---

<br>

India's bustling ride-hailing industry has long been dominated by two major players: Ola and Uber.

Between 2014 and 2018, this duopoly faced minimal competition, with players like Taxi For Sure, Meru Cabs, and EasyCabs relegated to the periphery. However, the landscape was about to shift with the arrival of an unexpected contender.

<br>

## Disrupting the Duopoly



While Uber and Ola were focused on expanding their cab and auto-hailing services and vying for market share, Rapido turned its attention to a niche market that was previously underserved. Instead of competing head-to-head in the crowded ride-hailing space, Rapido concentrated on bike taxis. By harnessing the agility of bikes, Rapido offered a faster and more cost-effective option for short-distance travel.

Though bike taxis were not a novel concept—Grab and GoJek had already established dominance in Southeast Asia—Rapido was the first to effectively adapt this model to the Indian market.

Rapido's growth trajectory has been impressive, expanding its services to over 100 cities across India. The company's ability to penetrate Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where public transportation infrastructure is often inadequate, has been a significant factor in its widespread adoption. 

## Rapido's entry into Auto and Cab market



By 2020, Rapido had established itself as the leading bike taxi provider in India. Building on this success, Rapido ventured into the auto-taxi market in 2020 and the cab-taxi market in 2023. This expansion was strategically sound, as revenue from cabs and autos is generally higher than that from bike taxis. Additionally, with incumbents like Ola and Uber launching their own bike-taxi services, Rapido faced increased competition in its original market segment.

It was finally time for Rapido to challenge the incumbents head-on. However, Rapido recognized that directly competing with Ola and Uber would be a formidable task. Instead, the company opted for a **differentiated business model** and an **innovative product strategy** to carve out its niche and effectively compete.
