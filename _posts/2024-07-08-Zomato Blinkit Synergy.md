title: Zomato Blinkit Synergy
---

India is currently witnessing an intense Quick Commerce battle, with companies like Zepto, Instamart, Blinkit, and BigBasket vying for market share. This competitive landscape is reminiscent of the early 2010s food delivery scene. 

Who would emerge victorious is anyone's guess. However, I have recently come across a integration which has led me to believe that Blinkit and Instamart might definitely have an edge.

Recently, I was ordering a birthday cake for a friend and hoped the bakery would sell candles too. Unfortunately, it did not. So, I made a mental note to order candles from a quick commerce app.

When I reached the order confirmation screen, I saw a banner suggesting I get party supplies and gifts from Blinkit in just 10 minutes. Intrigued, I clicked the banner and was redirected to the Blinkit app. There, I found various items needed for party decoration and gifting!

This is a brilliant feature that leverages the synergy between Zomato and Blinkit. Zomato can promote Blinkit's services to its customer base at the most opportune moments, enhancing the value offered to users and delighting them.

This competitive moat is an advantage Blinkit enjoys that other quick commerce companies like Zepto and BigBasket do not have. Will this alone be sufficient to overtake the competition? Probably not. However, in a competitive landscape, any advantage over rivals should not be ignored.
